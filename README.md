This study integrated gene expression data, microRNA expression data, and protein expression data obtained from tumor tissues into _MOFA2_ for 481 breast cancer patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort who had not received prior treatment or had no history of disease before their breast cancer diagnosis. The goal was to present new subgroups that better explain prognostic differences than the existing PAM50-based breast cancer subtypes and to identify the key omics signatures and biological pathways driving these differences.

## Background
#### 1) Breast Cancer

* Breast cancer is a highly clinically and molecularly heterogeneous cancer type, and the well-established PAM50-based subtypes are widely used to predict prognosis and treatment response.
* However, multiple studies have shown that heterogeneity exists even within the same subtype, and clinical outcomes vary significan.
* Based on these limitations, we sought to integrate multiple omics data from breast cancer to propose a new subtype that better explains prognostic differences than the existing PAM50 subtype.
